# PATMAT Person Aware Tuning of MAsk Aware Transformer for FAce Inpainting    (ICCV 2023)

<!-- > Generative models such as StyleGAN2 and Stable Diffusion have achieved state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks such as image synthesis, inpainting, and de-noising. However, 
current generative models for face inpainting often fail to preserve fine facial details and the identity of the person, despite creating aesthetically convincing image structures and textures.
In this work, we propose Person Aware Tuning (PAT) of Mask-Aware Transformer (MAT) for face inpainting, which addresses this issue. Our proposed method, PATMAT, effectively preserves identity by
incorporating reference images of a subject and fine-tuning a MAT architecture trained on faces. By using ~40 reference images, PATMAT creates anchor points in MAT's style module, and tunes the model
using the fixed anchors to adapt the model to a new face identity. Moreover, PATMAT's use of multiple images per anchor during training allows the model to use fewer reference images than competing methods.
We demonstrate that PATMAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of image quality, the preservation of person-specific details, and the identity of the subject. Our results suggest that PATMAT can be a promising approach for improving the quality of personalized face inpainting. -->

Pivotal Tuning Inversion (PTI) enables employing off-the-shelf latent based
semantic editing techniques on real images using StyleGAN. 
PTI excels in identity preserving edits, portrayed through recognizable figures â€”
Serena Williams and Robert Downey Jr. (top), and in handling faces which
are clearly out-of-domain, e.g., due to heavy makeup (bottom).

By default, we assume that all auxiliary models are downloaded and saved to the directory `pretrained_models`. 
However, you may use your own paths by changing the necessary values in `configs/path_configs.py`.
